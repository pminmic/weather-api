# Weather Display on LCD Using Raspberry Pi and an API

This project involves displaying the weather conditions of a specific city on an LCD screen connected to a Raspberry Pi. The weather data is fetched using an API and displayed in real-time on the LCD. This API is from [el-tiempo.net](https://www.el-tiempo.net/api) with provides data for Spain.

## How Did I Get Here?
I started this project because I wanted to experiment with using an API. Initially, I didn’t plan to use a Raspberry Pi, but after finding one in my father's desk, I decided to incorporate it into the project, and everything took off from there.
  
## What's Next?

My plan is to update the README whenever I feel like it, documenting the process and sharing my progress.
